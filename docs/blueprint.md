## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neon purple (#7c3aed) to match the futuristic theme of the website.
- Background color: Dark slate (#1E293B), a desaturated version of the primary color to create a dark color scheme. Hex code is approximate; tune for effect.
- Accent color: Indigo (#4f46e5) provides a visual contrast against the purple and slate, complementing the neon theme.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font, should be used to create a tech-friendly, readable UI.
- Use minimalistic icons from Heroicons to complement the modern and clean design.
- Use a grid-based layout for the main content area, with a sidebar for trending tags and subscription form.
- Use subtle animations and transitions for loading states and user interactions to enhance the user experience.
